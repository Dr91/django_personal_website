        <p>The picture in the homepage is the surface science instrument I
        have designed and built during my Ph.D study in chemistry. It is
        capable of atomic layer deposition, in situ analysis of as-deposited
        samples via XPS and TPD, as well as deposition of size-selected metal
        clusters on substrates in ultra-high vacuum.

        <p>I have done plenty of data analysis at my work using different
        programming tools, however, ever since I laid my hands on Python, I
        just couldn't let it go. It made me fall in love with programming. It
        is so powerful and I even built my entire site with python django as
        my backend.</p>

        <p>I will randomly post some stuff that I have learned about
        programming in my blog, mainly as a learning journal for myself and a
        way to motivate me to get better. My current focus, apart from
        chemistry of course, is machine learning and deep learning, as I can
        easily transfer my data analysis skill sets into these areas.</p>

        <p>I am also a fan of homebrew, not a brewmaster though, but good
        enough to keep myself entertained.</p>
